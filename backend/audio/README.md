# Audio Files

Place your MP3 file here and rename it to `sample.mp3`

The backend server will look for:

- `sample.mp3` in this directory

If you want to use a different filename, update the `inputPath` variable in `backend/server.js`

## Supported Formats

- MP3 files
- Any audio format supported by FFmpeg can be used with minor code modifications
